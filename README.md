A Movie Streaming Site 

# ABOUT 
# Hi there! My name is Sabina Rai. I have a strong background in visual communication and design and have recently taken on my journey in front-end development. 

## This is my first project fully built by myself to showcase the skills I have learnt. 
## See below the details of my process and progress - I hope you enjoy it! 

# PROJECT INTRO // DESCRIPTION 
## I thought about making a movie streaming site after using Disney + for the first time a few months ago. Despite being one of the most popular streaming sites there were elements I felt were wrong and even missing from the UX and UI. Comparing to Netflix, which has many more years on Disney + (Netflix lanuched in 2007, a whole 12 years before Disney +'s soft launch in Sept 2019 and hard launch in Nov 2019), I was still unimpressed by Disney's platform. One (of many) noticeable flaws is there is no "previous episode" navigation when watching a series. Instead a user would have to skip to the end of the current episode and go back to "view series info" to navigate to a previous episode.. Since noticing something so basic missing I began to notice more issues, which led me to creating Mov Com. 

## Mov Com is not intended to be fully functional, but a demonstration of what I feel is vital in providing a good user experience. More importantly my UI design style is very striped back, clean and simple, and it was important to me that this project reflects that as well. 

# AIMS // GOALS

## Create a simple movie streaming platform combining minimal design with streamlined functionality.
