# 🎬  Mov Com
A Movie Streaming Site by Sabina Rai (2023)

## ⚡️ About: 
Hi there! My name is `Sabina Rai.` I have a strong background in visual communication and design and have recently taken on my journey in front-end development. 

This is my first project `fully built by myself` to showcase the skills I have learnt. 

See below the details of my process and progress - enjoy! 

## 📝 Project Info & Description: 
I thought about making a movie streaming site after using `Disney+` for the first time a few months ago. Despite being one of the most popular streaming sites there were elements I felt were wrong and even missing from the `UX and UI.` Comparing to `Netflix,` which does have many more years on Disney+ (Netflix lanuched in 2007, a whole 12 years before Disney+'s launch in 2019), I was still unimpressed by Disney's UX. 

One (of many) flaws is there is no "previous episode" navigation when watching a series. Instead a user must skip to the end of the current episode to the credit page and then go back to "view series info" to order to navigate to a previous episode.. Noticing a basic element such as this missing it inspired my enthusiasm to create this mini project; `Mov Com.` 

`Please note:` Mov Com is not intended to be fully functional, but a demonstration of what I have recently learned and what I feel provides good user experience.  

## 🎯 Project Aim:

* Build a simple movie streaming platform combining minimal design with `streamlined functionality.` 

* Focus on creating a clean and `minimal interface.` 

* Demonstrate my `new skills!` 

## 🚀 Process Breakdown:

* Rough hand drawn wireframes to explore general layout.
* Use Miro App to fine tune wireframes 
* Use Figma to build low fidelity prototype 
* Use Figma to build hi fidelity prototypes of core elements
* Use Figma code inspector to gather CSS style info
* Use Figma code inspector to gather grids, guides & measurements. 
* Prepare images & text content 
* Organize all files ready for development
